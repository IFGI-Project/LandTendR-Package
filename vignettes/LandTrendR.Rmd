)
```

## Package set up

This package requires configuration before going live. As it is based on the RGEE library it has a different environment configuration. The first step is to install the package:

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
library(LandTrendR)
```

Before using it, a virtual environment must be generated for the python dependencies to work correctly. 

```{r virtualenv, eval=FALSE}
rgee::ee_install()
```

If you have any problems, please clear the virtual environment cache of rgee with the following command 

```{r cleaning, eval=FALSE}
rgee::ee_clean_pyenv()
```

And restart the R version if the issue persists.
